# Technical Task Motor AI

#### Author: Andr√©s Prada

## Description: 
This notebook presents the solution for the technical task proposed for the selection process in Motor AI. This task requires to compress the images in the dataset TRDS through an existing pre-trained model and extract the feature vector at a certain layer. These feature vectors need to be clustered afterward using a clustering algorithm. Finally, the performance of the model needs to be evaluated using the proper metrics.

## Methodology
This task can be divided into two smaller tasks, that each of them is independent of the other one. The first task would consist of choosing a pre-trained model that could perform fine with the dataset given. Also, it is important to wisely choose the layer on which the feature vectors are extracted would be. The second task is related to the clustering technique that could be used to cluster those feature vectors, and the metrics that could show how well the model performs. For the first task, the selection of an efficient model has its limitations:

* Since one of the constraints is to get rid of the training step, the number of possible solutions drastically. The first idea was to find a pre-trained model that was used for a similar problem. Ideally, any model which was trained on some dataset containing Traffic Signs of any type would perform better than other models trained on other types of data. The first approach was to research this problem. In 'Deep neural network for traffic sign recognition systems: An analysis of spatial transformers and stochastic optimisation methods', a novel CNN is presented. This architecture relies on spatial transformers and three different convolution layers. The implemented code could be found in GitHub, however, it is implemented in Lua, and the weights attached use some CUDNN layers, making it impossible to parse the weights file without a CUDA supported machine.

* The second option was to research any pre-trained model used for classification tasks and compare the performance of those networks on different datasets. All of the pre-trained models in Keras were pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset. Checking the benchmark (`https://keras.io/applications/#documentation-for-individual-models`) of the different available pre-trained models on this dataset, it is possible to observe the models that perform the best for the problem. The best results on the pre-trained dataset were obtained by NASNetLarge, followed by InceptionResNetV2 and Xception. Despite these models could perform reasonably good for the TSRD dataset, it does not mean that any of them could be the best model for the task. They also have a main drawback: they take as input images of very big sizes compared to TSRD dataset: 331x331 for the NASNet and 299x299 for the InceptionResNetV2 and Xception. This expansion in each of the images could not exploit all of the possibilities of such deep models.

*  A third alternative to this first task was found when the pre-trained model in `https://github.com/geifmany/cifar-vgg` with the weights in the CIFAR100 dataset was found. This was trained on the VGG16 model. This pre-trained model had the advantage that the images taken as input were resized to 32x32, which are closer to the 96x96 size that the images in TSRD have. 

*  Finally, ResNet152 was worth a try since this architecture has proved a great ability to generalize in many different applications. This network takes as input 224x224 images, and it was pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset.

To this point, four different architectures were selected to model this problem. The goal was to build the whole pipeline and stick with the model that could perform the best. The layer on which the feature vectors would depend on the architecture. For the VGG16, they would be extracted after the last batch normalization, before the last Dense layer that execute the classification itself. In the rest of the networks, those vectors would be extracted after the last convolutional layer, where a global average is applied. The size of these vectors will be of 512 for the VGG16 model, 1536 for the InceptionResNetV2, 2048 for the Xception and the ResNet152 and 4032 for the NASNetLarge. The feature vectors are extracted in this position due to its compression size of the features. This is where the feature vectors are better represented, just before the classification step.

The second part of this task consists of the clustering of all of these vectors and evaluate, with the appropriate metric, the chosen model. The most famous and used technique that could be used straight forward for this problem is the KMeans algorithm. This algorithm assigns each of the features vectors to a cluster in which each feature vector belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean, serving as a model of the cluster. Also, Agglomerative Clustering could provide efficient performance for the task.

Finally, a metric is needed to validate the clustering method. According to the research, the most common metric to validate unsupervised learning is the evaluation of similarity with Normalized Mutual Information (NMI). This metric is computed as is shown in the image below. It takes as input the true labels and the predicted labels obtained for each cluster.

This was found in https://course.ccs.neu.edu/cs6140sp15/7_locality_cluster/Assignment-6/NMI.pdf

## Results
All of the networks explained above were tested using only the images in the training set, containing a total of 4170 images samples. Each of the architectures was tested using the following pipeline:

* Images were resized to the corresponding input size of each network and added a fourth dimension. For example, the tensor input for the NASNetLarge is `[1, 331, 331, 3]`.
* The images are fed into the network and the feature vectors for each of the images is extracted at each point.
* These vectors were clustered with KMeans clustering.
* The NMI was computed.

Finally, for the network that achieved the highest NMI, the Agglomerative Clustering could be used to check if it could achieve higher NMI. The results for the different networks were the following:

|  Model | Weights | Image input size | Time(s) | NMI |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| VGG16 | CIFAR100 | 32x32 | 59.06 | 0.4630 |
| InceptionResNetV2 | ImageNet | 299x299 | 1217.40 | 0.3082 |
|  NASNetLarge | ImageNet | 331x331 | 6221.83 | 0.3850 |
|  Xception | ImageNet | 299x299 | 1310.48 | 0.3913 |
|  ResNet152 | ImageNet | 224x224 | 1562.28 | 0.6308 |

The conclussions that can be extracted from these results are the following: First of all, the highest Normalized Mutual Information score was obtained by the ResNet152. Comparing this network to rest of them on the ImageNet benchmark, it obtained notably worse accuracy.

Another conclusion that could be extracted from the comparison of those networks is that, although those networks could achieve high accuracy on the ImageNet dataset, they are not able to generate clear clusterable feature vectors for this problem. Leaving aside the rest of the networks but ResNet152, some conclusions can be extracted from these clusters. However, before moving on to the analysis of the clusters, Agglomerative Clustering was used to compare both clustering algorithms.

| Model | Clustering method | NMI |
|---|---|---|
| ResNet152 | KMeans |0.6308 | 
| ResNet152 | Agglomerative Clustering | **0.6411** |

Since the highest NMI was obtained using ResNet152 and Agglomerative Clustering, this pipeline was used to analyze the results. To do this, a matrix with *true label - cluster* images was be created as explained above. This confusion matrix can be seen in the figure below. In the y-axis are the true label of the images, and in the x-axis the number of images of that true class were assigned to that cluster.

Although given the number of classes is difficult to properly observe each of the classes, some of them show very clear results. For example, all of the 6 images that correspond to the category 57, have been clustered together. Also, images from labels 26 and 11 have been clustered among those. More examples of this can be found in the table above.

As it is possible to observe in the table above, some very big clusters gathered images from many categories, for example, cluster 3 and cluster 9. Most of the images that are clutered together have some visual similarities. For example, in cluster 9, there are images from labels from 40 until 51 (but 48). All of those images are visually alike. All of them are represented as a triangle in white - black colors. Also, images from labels from 0 to 7, are clustered together. All of those images are numerically and rounded traffic signs.

On the other hand, this model is not able to differentiate properly the clusters. Many equally labeled images are divided into two or more clusters. For example, in label 28, it is possible to observe that its images are clusterd more or less homogeneous along 6 clusters. This denotes a poor performance of the model.

Finally, for visualization purposes, the features vectors extracted are shown using dimensionality reduction TSNE.
